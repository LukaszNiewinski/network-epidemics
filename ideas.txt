1) create N (e.g. = 10) randomly generated scale free networks.
2) use created networks to test the disesase spreading without awareness spreading.
3) use created networks to test the disesase spreading with awareness spreading. (vary betas, delta, awareness spreading speed)
4) start to vary the topology of both networks.

Extra ideas - media effect on disease spreading; what if the hubs are the initally infected nodes (the same for the infected ones)


SI MODEL:
1) turn off awareness spreading and test how the variation of beta affects the disease spreading:
    - infection rates throughout time.
    - infection threshold plot for different parameter values.
2) fix beta to a value and test how the variation of mu affects the disease spreading. (plot also the curve without the awareness spreding process):
    - infection rates throughout time.
    - infection threshold plot for different parameter values.
3) fix beta and mu to a value and test how the variation of lambda affects the disease spreading. (plot also the curve without the awareness spreding process):
    - infection rates throughout time.
    - infection threshold plot for different parameter values.
4) fix beta and vary both mu and lambda: plot the infection threshold on a 2d grid (encode the threshold with colors).

gradients

vary network degree.
