1) create N (e.g. = 10) randomly generated scale free networks.
2) use created networks to test the disesase spreading without awareness spreading.
3) use created networks to test the disesase spreading with awareness spreading. (vary betas, delta, awareness spreading speed)
4) start to vary the topology of both networks.

Extra ideas - media effect on disease spreading; what if the hubs are the initally infected nodes (the same for the infected ones)
